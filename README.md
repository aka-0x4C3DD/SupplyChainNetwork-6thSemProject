Project Scope
------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to develop a web-based decentralized supply-chain management system that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and accountability throughout the entire supply chain. The system will be designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible to all stakeholders involved in the supply chain process.
It will involve different participants who will be able to create purchase orders to purchase commodities. Participants can initiate a purchase order for the commodity, and the commodity will be transferred between participants through two transactions. Two transactions will be involved in this process - the initiation of a purchase order and the transfer of the commodity based on the purchase order. The network will be built using Hyperledger composer Business Network which can be deployed at supported runtimes.

## Requirement Design

<div align="center">

![requirement-design.png](https://github.com/aka-0x4C3DD/SupplyChainNetwork-6thSemProject/blob/main/support/requirement-design-ve.png)

</div>

**Participants**: Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, Consumer Assets: Commodity, Purchase Order
**Transactions**: Initiate Purchase Order, Transfer Commodity

Logic â€“
- **Initiate Purchase Order**: When a participant calls this transaction a new asset is created under Purchase Order this entry includes the demanded items, their supporting accessories, the supplier etc.
- **Transfer Commodity**: When this transaction is called a new owner is assigned to the commodity based on the stage and is called against purchase order.

Based on the above diagram we will create a business network structure based on all the initial participants in mind. Define it and generate archive files for the same using the composer. Then we will deploy the business network over a runtime environment which will include Hyperledger fabric, web and embedded NodeJS for the convenient access by the stakeholders.
